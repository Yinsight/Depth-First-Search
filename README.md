# DFS

Given a directed graph G = {V,E} encoded as an adjacency list, an efficient implementaton of DFS runs in O(|V|+|E|) steps.

This program creates an adjacency list which choosing the edges at random. 

The program also measures and displays running time.

The user is prompted to input the number of nodes and the number of edges.
